My research centers on enhancing diffusion models, emphasizing sample quality/diversity, sampling speed, and controllable generation. I am also interested about inverse problems, particularly in media restoration, utilizing generative models. Additionally, I explore mathematically explainable AI, aiming to unravel the intricacies of artificial intelligence through rigorous mathematical frameworks.</p> <p>##Previously</p> <p>I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota – Twin Cities in May 2021. Under the supervision of <a href="[https://link-url-here.org](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zCzuViIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en)">Gilad Lerman</a> and in close collaboration with <a href="[https://link-url-here.org](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Dongmian.Zou)">Dongmian Zou</a>, my research centered on constructing outlier robustness models and developing methodologies for outlier detection. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.</p> </body></html>
