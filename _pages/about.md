### Currently
I am a research scientist/tech leader at Music Foundation Model Team of Sony AI, specializing in deep generative modeling and robustness. My research centers on enhancing diffusion models, emphasizing sample quality/diversity, sampling speed, and controllable generation. I am also interested about inverse problems, particularly in media restoration, utilizing generative models. Additionally, I explore mathematically explainable AI, aiming to unravel the intricacies of artificial intelligence through rigorous mathematical frameworks.

### Previously

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities in May 2021. Under the supervision of [Gilad Lerman]([https://link-url-here.org](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zCzuViIAAAAJ&hl=en)) and in close collaboration with [Dongmian Zou]([https://link-url-here.org](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Dongmian.Zou)), my research centered on constructing outlier robustness models and developing methodologies for outlier detection. I obtained my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan.
