### Currently
I am a staff research scientist and tech lead at Sony AI's Music Foundation Model Team, focusing on deep generative modeling and robustness, particularly the foundations of diffusion models in collaboration with [Prof. Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/). Additionally, I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University's Applied Mathematics Department, where I collaborate and supervise students with [Prof. Ming-Chih Lai](https://jupiter.math.nycu.edu.tw/~mclai/) on deep learning methods for partial differential equations.  

My current research centers on enhancing diffusion models, emphasizing sample quality/diversity, sampling speed, and controllable generation. I am also interested about inverse problems, particularly in media restoration, utilizing generative models. Additionally, I explore mathematically explainable AI, aiming to unravel the intricacies of artificial intelligence through rigorous mathematical frameworks.

I lead and released the book **[The Principles of Diffusion Models](https://the-principles-of-diffusion-models.github.io/)** with [Yang Song](https://yang-song.net/), [Dongjun Kim](https://sites.google.com/view/dongjun-kim), [Yuki Mitsufuji](https://www.yukimitsufuji.com/), and [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/). It offers a principled, systematic guide to diffusion modeling and connects these foundations to modern few-step generative methods, including *flow map models*.


### Previously

I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities in May 2021. Under the supervision of [Prof. Gilad Lerman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zCzuViIAAAAJ&hl=en) and in close collaboration with [Prof. Dongmian Zou](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/Dongmian.Zou), my research centered on constructing outlier robustness models and developing methodologies for outlier detection. I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from National Tsing Hua University, Taiwan in 2015. Here is my [Mathematics Genealogy](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=274972).
