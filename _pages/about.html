My research centers on enhancing diffusion models, emphasizing sample quality/diversity, sampling speed, and controllable generation. I am also interested about inverse problems, particularly in media restoration, utilizing generative models. Additionally, I explore mathematically explainable AI, aiming to unravel the intricacies of artificial intelligence through rigorous mathematical frameworks.</p> <h3 id="previously">Previously</h3> <p>I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Minnesota – Twin Cities in May 2021.
